Description of directories:

  _asserts : This directory contains a small C++ program, one that
             doesn't even have any new classes to define new 
             data types. 

  _courses : This directory contains a somewhat larger C++ program,
             including a non-primitive type with a member variable 
             whose type is another non-primitive type (in particular,
             Schedule uses the CourseInfo type). 
              
  _java : This directory contains a program as similar as possible
          to that in _courses, but implemented in Java instead of
          C++. We provide it only for comparison purposes -- those
          of you who know Java but not C++ could compare the 
          code in _courses to this code to see the similarities
          and differences. You will *never* be tested on anything
          Java-related in CS225. 


The code in _asserts and _courses is what you want to make sure
you understand. If after having the first three lectures and first
discussion section, and looking carefully over your notes from those
lectures and that section, you still have questions about some of the
code in _asserts and _courses, please ask! You are responsible for
understanding that code.
