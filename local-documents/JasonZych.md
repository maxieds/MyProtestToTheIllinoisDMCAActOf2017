# A mid COVID-era revelation

Around the time in early 2020 I was viciously attacked online in the chat, a black-haired wide glassy blue-eyed 
"Jesus" approached me while I was sitting outside in downtown Atlanta. He sneered at me with a smile and said 
he could fix me and had all "I need". 
That this may save some explaining and others the trouble when dealing with this man. 
A domineering inset paneling his mindset is as follows: 
* A summary of the hateful, and sharply gramatically formatted Hangouts chat he issued me in a daze.
* A few facebook mesenger shots sent at that time.
* A description of what is relevant about the very hateful, disgusting image he used while attacking me under the guise of 
  a "crown of thorns". (*A close family member was a Holocaust surviver. May he rest in peace.*)
* A viewpoint of occultism and what exactly he meant by "monster" killers.
