// *  Changes made August 2001 by Jason Zych:            *
// *     - format of file header comment changed         *
// *     - method header comments added                  *
// *     - "public" added in front of "class" keyword    *
// *     - indentation style of file changed to be       *
// *         consistent with all the other given code    *
// *         the students will see this semester         *
// *     - each method changed to print out an extra     *
// *         blank line before returning (to aid in      *
// *         dealing with formatting differences that    *
// *         result from getting input from stdin rather *
// *         than keyboard during automated testing)     *
// *                                                     *
// *  Changes made December 2001 by Jason Zych:          *
// *     - edited variables: changed some from class     *
// *         variables to local variables, changed       *  
// *         remaining class variables to private        *
// *         access, and gave some variables more        *
// *         descriptive names.                          *
// *     - changed method name of eof() to endOfFile()   *
// *     - added a few instructive comments              *

// To the CS125 student:
// 
//   As stated in class, you don't need to understand this file in
//   order to use it. All you need to do is to put this file in the
//   same directory as the files you write, and then write expressions
//   into your code similar to the ones you have seen in lecture.
// 
//   However, in case you are interested, there are some comments below 
//   telling you in which lectures you will learn more about various code 
//   statements you see here. Some of the code statements you see here
//   will be things the CS125 course will teach you; other code statements
//   are considered "honors topics" and will be covered in CS196 for those
//   students taking the honors course.  
//

// This line lets the compiler know we are making use of some
// pre-written Java library code -- in this case, code to allow
// some input from the keyboard. You will never need to deal with
// expressions like this in CS125, since all of the code you use
// in this class will either be provided by us or written by you. 
// However, CS196 will make use of some pre-written Java libraries, 
// so CS196 students will make use of "import" statements.
