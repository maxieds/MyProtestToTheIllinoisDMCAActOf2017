The directory _lectureList has three different implementations of a
List ADT similar to the one we have looked at in lecture. 

The directory _lectureStack has two different implementations
of a Stack ADT.

The directory _lectureQueue has two different implementations
of a Queue ADT.

The directory _c++stdlist contains our implementation 
of (most of) the C++ STL list class, complete with all
four iterator types.


Each of the four directories has one or more pairs of files to 
inspect more closely, along with a "_runThisCode/" directory where 
you can find some files to compile together with that code, and
a test.1.std which contains the output for such a program.
