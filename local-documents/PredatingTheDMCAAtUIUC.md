# A revealing look at attitudes towards the DMCA from 2005

In addition to the source in the [code library]() for 
CS225 labs at UIUC around 2005, I pulled some dated files 
off my backup media which are suggestive of approval on the 
part of the instructors for the course around that time. 
The following legalese jibberish is senslessly offsensive:

Moreover, we might as well dwell on the next (in)formative copyright 
notice on the university funded educational materials 
produced by the CS department many years ago (as in when I was 
young, and you all were in diapers):

And finally, let's not spend too much time emphasizing that I 
did actually spend *some* time studying for my CS classes 
before dropping two of them that year:

## Credit where credit is due

If you want to sincerely 
thank [Jas0n](https://github.com/maxieds/MyProtestToTheIllinoisDMCAActOf2017/blob/master/local-documents//ThankingJasonForHisHacking.md) 
(and profusely) for his contribution and 
time to enhance the offsensive prosecutions of CS undergrads for their 
percieved sins, his email addresses are linked 
[here](mailto:Jason.Zych@gmail.com) and [here](mailto:jzych3@gmail.com) 
(I couldn't find his official CV to link to online these days -- therefore, 
we must assume it doesn't exist). I sincerely hope that all of the 
"youngsters" who can now benefit from the [code library](https://github.com/maxieds/MyProtestToTheIllinoisDMCAActOf2017/blob/master/code-library-sources/) 
(especially this STL gem which [sadly Cinda Heeren missed](https://github.com/maxieds/MyProtestToTheIllinoisDMCAActOf2017/blob/master/code-library-sources/03-c++generic/_c++stdvector/vector225.cpp) -- 
[header file](https://github.com/maxieds/MyProtestToTheIllinoisDMCAActOf2017/blob/master/code-library-sources/03-c++generic/_c++stdvector/vector225.h)) 
will choose to thank me by (en)forcing the painfull process of having to change 
longstanding GMail addresses on Jason Zych by DOS-ing his 
old school Un1x spam filter: 
```
HELL_FREEZES_OVER = ((2**32 - 1))
int_i="0"
while[ $int_i -lt $HELL_FREEZES_OVER ]; do
     echo -e "So long, and thanks for all the code, \t\t\t\t\t\t\tJason!" | \
              mail -s "See message line." jason.zych@gmail.com;
     int_i=$[$int_i + 1];
fi
```
