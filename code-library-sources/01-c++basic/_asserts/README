If the files are compiled and run in their current form,
then the output of the resultant program should match the
text in test.1.std. However, to see the output of the Assert
functions, you can uncomment one or both of the two Assert
calls in main.cpp and then re-compile and re-run the program.
In that case, the output of the program would be different
than the text in test.1.std.
