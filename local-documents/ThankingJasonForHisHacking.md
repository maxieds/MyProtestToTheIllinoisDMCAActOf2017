# A few highlights about the man, the myth, the legend himself

A few links which have survived 15 years or so of Google iterations 
suggest the following answers to the question: 
*Who was Jason Zych?* ([indeed](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/6kapwr/who_is_jason_zych/) and [ditto](https://www.facebook.com/UIUC.CS225/posts/i-had-jason-zych-during-his-last-semester-teaching-here-bring-back-the-mountain-/325944075682/)):

**(@theillini19 from Reddit)**

*He's a "myth" as old as the UIUC CS program itself. The situation is kind of like Homer's The Odyssey- no one knows if 
Homer was an actual person, or if the epic was created by a group of people over many years. 
Same thing with the CS notes by Jason Zych.*

Some people who are good with data mining can still find old images of him on 
Google images, including one of him as a lucky X-Windows loving teenager and 
the [lost faculty image of him](https://cs.illinois.edu/directory/profile/zych) which 
used to be linked on the CS department's [webpage](http://cs.uiuc.edu). A few other 
images worth literally 1000's of words of note taking:

He was also the only instructor I was in class with in my tenure at UIUC who never 
introduced himself to the students in his class on day one, and still insisted on 
being called on by the ubiquitous first-name-only basis. I personally miss the days in that 
class when the lecturer on board would scream "*Lecture has started! [STFU, boys]*" in class 
with the microphone on to indicate that talking (or whispering) in class was not to be tolerated. 
It was in fact distinctively clearly voiced on the course website and newsgroups that complete handwritten 
lecture notes each MWF-day could be downloaded off of the course website to make up for this 
anticipated rudeness when it came up. 

Some former all-star students and TAs still quote him like a king around the web. I have another suggestion:

“*You* **will** *experience testosterone in this department. Just (like) give it back to them!*” — Cinda Heeren, WIE summer pre-camp (circa 2004)
