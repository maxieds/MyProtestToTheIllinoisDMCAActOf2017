03-c++generic:
--------------

The directory _simpleGenArray has an example of a generic array
class, where instead of an "array of ints" or "array of string 
pointers", you have an "array of whatevers" because it is a template 
class. 

The directory _intIter has an example of a simple iterator
added to the integer array wrapper class you've already seen.

The directory _c++stdvector contains our implementation 
of (most of) the C++ STL vector class, complete with all
four iterator types.

The directory _fullGenArray contains the class from _simpleGenArray, 
complete with STL-equivalent iterator support added to it. 

The directory _genericFns contains an example of using the vector 
and Array (from _fullGenArray) classes (and their iterators) and 
generic functions, all together. 




Each of the five directories has a pair of files to inspect 
more closely, along with a "_runThisCode/" directory where you
can find some files to compile together with that code, and
a test.1.std which contains the output for such a program.
