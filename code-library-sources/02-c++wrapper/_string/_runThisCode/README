The code as written should compile and produce the output seen
in the text file test.1.std.

If you uncompile line 29 of main.cpp and recompile the code, you
will see a compiler error relating to the fact that the call to
operator[] on that line is being called on a const object and thus
cannot return a modifiable value.
