Testing stack code
-----------------

 - Testing array implementation:
 
     1) copy array-implemented-stack.* to this directory
     2) uncomment the #include line for that .h file in stackTest.C
     3) copy Makefile.arr to Makefile 
     4) run `make', and then run the resultant a.out. Results should
         match test.1.std

 - Testing implementation that uses List class:

     1) copy list-implemented-stack.* to this directory
     2) uncomment the #include line for that .h file in stackTest.C
     3) copy Makefile.list to Makefile
     4) run `make', and then run the resultant a.out. Results should
         match test.1.std

 - Testing implementation that uses nested singly-linked node class

     1) copy singly-linked-stack.* to this directory
     2) uncomment the #include line for that .h file in stackTest.C
     3) copy Makefile.sls to Makefile 
     4) run `make', and then run the resultant a.out. Results should
         match test.1.std

Note that all three implementations produce the same output, as they
should, since they are implementing the same interface.
