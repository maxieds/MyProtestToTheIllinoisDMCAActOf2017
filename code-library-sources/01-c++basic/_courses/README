If you comment out the #ifndef/#define/#endif lines in 
courseInfo.h, the program will not compile. 

After you compile, running the program with test.1 as input
should produce output identical to what is in test.1.std. 

   courseTest < test.1 > sampleFile

is the command that should be used, where "sampleFile" can be 
replaced with whatever other filename you want. (MP1 will
talk a bit more about input and output redirection.)
