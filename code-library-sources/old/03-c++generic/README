The directory _templateArray has an example of a generic array
class, where instead of an "array of ints" or "array of string pointers",
you have an "array of whatevers" because it is a template class. 

The directory _simpleIter has an example of a simple iterator
added to the integer array wrapper class you've already seen,
and a sample main() and Makefile with which to compile this class.
The file test.1.sample is what this program should produce as output.

The directory _c++stdvector contains our implementation 
of (most of) the C++ STL vector class, complete with all
four iterator types.

The directory _generic contains an example of using the vector
(and iterators to the vector), and function objects, and generic
functions, all together.
