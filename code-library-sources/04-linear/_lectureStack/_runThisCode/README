Testing stack code
-----------------

 - Testing array implementation:
 
     1) copy array-implemented-stack.* to this directory
     2) uncomment the #include line for that .h file in main.cpp
     3) copy Makefile.array to Makefile 
     4) run `make', and then run the resultant program. Results should
         match test.1.std

 - Testing implementation that uses nested singly-linked node class

     1) copy singly-linked-stack.* to this directory
     2) uncomment the #include line for that .h file in main.cpp
     3) copy Makefile.list to Makefile 
     4) run `make', and then run the resultant program. Results should
         match test.1.std

Note that both implementations produce the same output, as they
should, since they are implementing the same interface.
